## What i Learnd


## what i did
- saw everyones websites on the OIM3690 Gallery 
- learned the difference between GET and POST :
this is what chat gave me:
Ask for data (GET) = “Please show me something”
Example: opening a website page
Your browser asks the server: “Can I see this page?”
Send data (POST) = “Here is some information for you”
Example: submitting a form
Your browser sends the server info like your name, email, or password
Tiny example:
Click a link → GET
Click “Submit” on a form → POST
