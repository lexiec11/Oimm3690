## what i learned
did morewith the back of websites
learned what a GET and POST is 


## what i did
used ai to explain stuff and how to be more specific with my prompts:
this is what chat told me
Ask for data (GET) = “Please show me something”
Example: opening a website page
Your browser asks the server: “Can I see this page?”
Send data (POST) = “Here is some information for you”
Example: submitting a form
Your browser sends the server info like your name, email, or password
Tiny example:
Click a link → GET
Click “Submit” on a form → POST

looked at codes to see if i had any common questions
