# S03 – What I don’t understand yet (index.html)

1) What does `<!doctype html>` actually do, and what changes if it’s missing?
2) What is the difference between `<head>` and `<body>` in practice?
3) Why do we need `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />`?
4) What does `:root { ... }` mean in CSS, and why are variables written like `--accent`?
5) Why does `* { box-sizing: border-box }` matter? What would break without it?
6) What does `position: sticky` do in the header, and how is it different from `fixed`?
7) What is `backdrop-filter: blur(...)` and why doesn’t it work in some browsers?
8) What does `min-height: 100vh` mean and when should I use it?
9) How do CSS gradients work (radial vs linear), and how are multiple backgrounds layered?
10) What does `clamp(30px, 4vw, 46px)
